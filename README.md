# Hostfully Tech Test

This project was developed as a technical test for Hostfully. It showcases a React application for managing bookings, bootstrapped with Create React App and implemented using TypeScript, for a more structured and error-resistant codebase.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Manage bookings with options to create, read, update (reschedule), and delete (cancel) them.
- **Global State Management**: Uses React Context for management of booking data across the application.
- **Validation & User Experience**: Implements validations to prevent booking conflicts and ensure logical date ranges. Enhanced user experience through organized bookings, sorted first by status and then by check-in date.
- **Responsive Design and accessibility**: Ensures compatibility with desktop and mobile devices. Uses Radix lirary to allow a more personalized visual experience while ensuring accessibility and usability.
